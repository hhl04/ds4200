        With the latest installment in the franchise, <i>Alien: Romulus</i>, being 
        a box office hit gathering $350 million worldwide, this cosmos-spanning 
        franchise has received more attention from old and new fans alike. I dedicate this website
        to briefly list and explain all the main events of the <i>Alien</i> mytho,
        spanning five centuries across different movies, novels and video games.

        My first exposure to this franchise was in 2017, when I watched <i>Prometheus</i> and
        <i>Alien: Covenant</i>, both were not the best works to exist in this franchise. <br>
        Compared to previous entries, these two movies were experimental and trying to add more myths to 
        the popular-but-familiar <i>Xenomorph</i> mythos. The newly added myths were controversial
        but logical, but what drew the most criticism was the poorly written and executed scripts
        of these movies. I love the newly added myths, but am not fond of the poor screenplay.
